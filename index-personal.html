      <h2>Making finance more accessible, cheaper, and faster.</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I have seen, firsthand, the power that finance has on the world. It is a system that can facilitate so much growth, or stifle it just as quickly through abuses. Technology has come a long way, yet modern finance feels old. I believe archaic experiences and philosophies have led to many of our largest institutions falling behind on offering the best financial products. I know there is plenty of room for improvement. That is why I founded <a href="http://www.vesthq.com">Vest</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am in Chicago. If you’re interested in grabbing some coffee or playing some ping pong while talking about fintech, email me at <a href="mailto:tripathi@vesthq.com">tripathi@vesthq.com</a> or tweet me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/atfintech">@atfintech</a>. I’m always excited to meet fellow designers, developers, and entrepreneurs.

            “There’s no “should” or “should not” when it comes to having feelings. They’re part of who we are and their origins are beyond our control. When we can believe that, we may find it easier to make constructive choices about what to do with those feelings.”
